h1. CFMongoDB

CFMongoDB is both partial wrapper for the MongoDB Java driver and a document-struct mapper for ColdFusion. It attempts to remove the need for constant javacasting in your CFML when working with MongoDB. Additionally, there's a simple DSL which provides ColdFusion developers the ability to easily search MongoDB document collections.

CFMongoDB works with Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1+ and Railo 3.2+

h2. Notes

As of August 20, 2011, collection.update(), collection.findAndModify(), and "sort" all introduced breaking changes! 

h3. update() and findAndModify()

They no longer wrap documents in {$set} automatically.

You will need to change your "update" documents like so:

old: {newField="hey"}

new: { "$set" = {newField="hey"} }

h3. sort

Sort must now be a structure... string support is no longer supported.

old:  find(sort="TS=-1")

new: find(sort={"TS"=-1})

h2. Some Code

One of the most appealing aspects is that data can be created as a ColdFusion structure and persisted almost verbatim. Example:

<pre>
<cfscript>

//save
col = mongo.getDBCollection( 'my_collection' );
my_struct = {
  name = 'Orc #getTickCount()#'
  foo = 'bar'
  bar = 123
  'tags'=[ 'cool', 'distributed', 'fast' ]
};

col.save( my_struct );

//query
result = col.query().startsWith('name','Orc').find(limit=20);
writeOutput("Found #result.size()# of #result.totalCount()# Orcs");

//use the native mongo cursor. it is case sensitive!
cursor = result.asCursor();
while( cursor.hasNext() ){
  thisOrc = cursor.next();
  writeOutput(" name = #thisOrc['name']# <br>");
}

//use a ColdFusion array of structs. this is not case sensitive
orcs = result.asArray();
for(orc in orcs){
  writeOutput(" name = #orc.name# <br>");
}

</cfscript>
</pre>

We have a Google group: "http://groups.google.com/group/cfmongodb":http://groups.google.com/group/cfmongodb

Please limit conversations to MongoDB and ColdFusion. General MongoDB questions are best asked on the MongoDB group at "http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user":http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user

h2. Posting Issues

Post issues to the github issue tracker for the project. Better: post fixes. Best: post fixes with unit tests. 

h2. Getting Involved

Collaboration is welcome. Fork -- Commit -- Request a pull. For bug fixes and feature additions, commits with unit tests are much more likely to be accepted.

Code well.
